          <div>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation
            of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking
            order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or
            roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
            established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and
            injury.[30]

            When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch
            as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call
            their chicks and encourage them to eat.

            A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
            roosters.[31] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
            Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning
            calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[32]

            Crowing

            Bergische Kr√§her crowing

            The long crowing of a Berg crower
            File:Rooster crowing small.ogv
            Normal length crowing (with audio). Long-crowing chickens have a longer crow.
            Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as
            well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[33]

            Rooster crowing contests
            Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a traditional sport in several countries, such
            as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,[34] the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are
            held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the crowing or the times the rooster
            crows within a certain time is measured.

            Courtship
            To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often
            lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[35] The dance triggers a response in the hen[35] and when she
            responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.

            More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:

            Male approaching the hen
            Male pre-copulatory waltzing
            Male waltzing
            Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate)
            Male mounting
            Male treading with both feet on hen's back
            Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[36]
            Nesting and laying behaviour

            Chicken eggs vary in colour depending on the breed, and sometimes, the hen, typically ranging from bright
            white to shades of brown and even blue, green, light pinkish and recently reported purple (found in South
            Asia) (Araucana varieties).

            Chicks before their first outing
            Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from
            neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few
            preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a
            preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same
            nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result
            in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either
            solitary or gregarious nesters <a href='index.html' target='blank'
